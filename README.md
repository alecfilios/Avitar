> This master\'s thesis focuses on the development of a Serious Game,
> named Avitar, tailored for chronic disease management through an
> interactive approach. Traditional health apps often fail to engage
> users due to their perceived monotony. Avitar addresses this challenge
> by utilizing Unity and HealthKit API to create a visually appealing
> environment where an Avatar serves as a dynamic representation of the
> user\'s health status.
